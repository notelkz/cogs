<h1> DisApps | Discord Applications </h1>

A GenAI RedBot cog that enables you to have an application system in your server.

> My current usecase is for a gaming community. When someone joins the server, they are pinged a message/embed.
> You currently need the following for this to work: An 'Application' category, an 'Archive' category, a 'Moderator' role and a 'Role' that will be awarded to accepted applicants.

> I do plan on making improvements to this, or at least trying to over time.
