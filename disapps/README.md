<h1> DisApps | Discord Applications </h1>

A GenAI RedBot cog that enables you to have an application system within Discord.

> My current usecase is for a gaming community.

> You need the following for this to work: An 'Application' category, an 'Archive' category, a 'Moderator' role and a 'Role' that will be awarded to accepted applicants. You can use either IDs or @ mentions for Channels, Roles & Members. Categories can be added using IDs only.

> I do plan on making improvements to this, or at least trying to over time.
